# NATO Alphabet Learner

Access me on <https://nato.clh.sh>!

This is a very simple webapp to practice the NATO phonetic alphabet. I found a lot of multiple-choice quizzes online, but I couldn't find anything that tested word-by-word transcription, so I made this really quick in the style of a typing test (Ã  la [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com)).

Things to do if I ever work more on this:

- Ensure that the "rare" letters get some love in the words list. Right now, it's a random 1000 words taken from my laptop's `words` file.
- Display more letters, for more "lookahead" and context
- Timer!
- Make inputs prettier
